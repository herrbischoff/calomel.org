# TCP Tuning: The throughput of connection is limited by two windows: the
# (Initial) Congestion Window and the TCP Receive Window (RWIN). The Congestion
# Window avoids exceeding the capacity of the network (RACK, CAIA, H-TCP or
# NewReno congestion control); and the Receive Window avoids exceeding the
# capacity of the receiver to process data (flow control). When our server is
# able to process packets as fast as they are received we want to allow the
# remote sending host to send data as fast as the network, Congestion Window,
# will allow. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_tuning

# IPC Socket Buffer: the maximum combined socket buffer size, in bytes, defined
# by SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF. kern.ipc.maxsockbuf is also used to define the
# window scaling factor (wscale in tcpdump) our server will advertise. The
# window scaling factor is defined as the maximum volume of data allowed in
# transit before the recieving server is required to send an ACK packet
# (acknowledgment) to the sending server. FreeBSD's default maxsockbuf value is
# two(2) megabytes which corresponds to a window scaling factor (wscale) of
# six(6) allowing the remote sender to transmit up to 2^6 x 65,535 bytes =
# 4,194,240 bytes (4MB) in flight, on the network before requiring an ACK
# packet from our server. In order to support the throughput of modern, long
# fat networks (LFN) with variable latency we suggest increasing the maximum
# socket buffer to at least 16MB if the system has enough RAM. "netstat -m"
# displays the amount of network buffers used. Increase kern.ipc.maxsockbuf if
# the counters for "mbufs denied" or "mbufs delayed" are greater than zero(0).

# TCP Buffers: Larger buffers and TCP Large Window Extensions (RFC1323) can
# help alleviate the long fat network (LFN) problem caused by insufficient
# window size; limited to 65535 bytes without RFC 1323 scaling. Verify the
# window scaling extension is enabled with net.inet.tcp.rfc1323=1, which is
# default. Both the client and server must support RFC 1323 to take advantage
# of scalable buffers. A network connection at 100Mbit/sec with a latency of 10
# milliseconds has a bandwidth-delay product of 125 kilobytes
# ((100*10^6*10*10^-3)/8=125000) which is the same BDP of a 1Gbit LAN with

# latency and/or throughput increase so does the BDP. If the connection needs
# more buffer space the kernel will dynamically increase these network buffer
# values by net.inet.tcp.sendbuf_inc and net.inet.tcp.recvbuf_inc increments.
# Use "netstat -an" to watch Recv-Q and Send-Q as the kernel increases the

# CAIA-Delay Gradient (CDG) is a hybrid TCP congestion control algorithm which
# reacts to both packet loss and inferred queuing delay. CDG attempts to
# operate as a temporal, delay-based algorithm where possible while utilizing
# heuristics to detect loss-based TCP cross traffic and compete effectively
# against other packet loss based congestion controls on the network.
#
# During time-based operation, CDG uses a delay-gradient based probabilistic
# backoff mechanism to infer non-congestion related packet losses. CDG
# periodically switches to loss-based operation when it detects a configurable
# number of consecutive delay-based backoffs have had no measurable effect.
# During packet loss-based operation, CDG essentially reverts to
# cc_newreno-like behaviour. CDG oscillates between temporal, delay-based
# operation and packet loss-based operation as dictated by network conditions.

# maximum segment size (MSS) specifies the largest payload of data in a single
# IPv4 TCP segment. RFC 6691 states the maximum segment size should equal the
# effective MTU minus the fixed IP and TCP headers, but before subtracting IP
# options like TCP timestamps. Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) is not supported by
# all internet paths and can lead to increased connection setup latency so the
# MMS can be defined manually.
#
# Option 1 - Maximum Payload - To construct the maximum MMS, start with an
# ethernet frame size of 1514 bytes and subtract 14 bytes for the ethernet
# header for an interface MTU of 1500 bytes. Then subtract 20 bytes for the IP
# header and 20 bytes for the TCP header to equal an Maximum Segment Size (MSS)
# of tcp.mssdflt=1460 bytes. With net.inet.tcp.rfc1323 enabled the packet
# payload is reduced by a further 12 bytes and the MSS is reduced from
# tcp.mssdflt=1460 bytes to a packet payload of 1448 bytes total. An MMS of
# 1448 bytes has a 95.64% packet efficiency (1448/1514=0.9564).
#
# Option 2 - No Frags - Google states the HTTP/3 QUIC (Quick UDP Internet
# Connection) IPv4 datagram should be no larger than 1280 octets to attempt to
# avoid any packet fragmentation over any Internet path. To follow Google's
# no-fragment UDP policy for TCP packets set FreeBSD's MSS to 1240 bytes. To
# construct Google's no-fragment datagram start with an ethernet frame size of
# 1294 bytes and subtract 14 bytes for the ethernet header to equal Google's
# recommended PMTU size of 1280 bytes. Then subtract 20 bytes for the IP header
# and 20 bytes for the TCP header to equal tcp.mssdflt=1240 bytes. Then, before
# the packet is sent, FreeBSD will set the TCP timestamp (rfc1323) on the
# packet reducing the true packet payload (MSS) another 12 bytes from
# tcp.mssdflt=1240 bytes to 1228 bytes which has an 94.89% packet efficiency

# minimum, maximum segment size (mMSS) specifies the smallest payload of data
# in a single IPv4 TCP segment our system will agree to send when negotiating
# with the client. RFC 6691 states that a minimum MTU size of 576 bytes must be
# supported and the MSS option should equal the effective MTU minus the fixed
# IP and TCP headers, but without subtracting IP or TCP options. To construct
# the minimum MSS start with a frame size of 590 bytes and subtract 14 bytes
# for the ethernet header to equal the RFC 6691 recomended MTU size of 576
# bytes. Continue by subtracting 20 bytes for the IP header and 20 bytes for
# the TCP header to equal tcp.minmss=536 bytes. Then, before the packet is
# sent, FreeBSD will set the TCP timestamp (rfc1323) on the packet reducing the
# true packet payload (MSS) another 12 bytes from tcp.minmss=536 bytes to 524
# bytes which is 90.9% packet efficiency (524/576=0.909). The default mMMS is

# RFC 8511 TCP Alternative Backoff with ECN (ABE) for FreeBSD's default

# assumption can be made that the bottleneck network queue is transient. The
# feedback of this signal allows the TCP sender-side ECN reaction in congestion
# avoidance to reduce the Congestion Window (cwnd) by a less aggressive 20%
# rather than the NewReno default of 50% when inferred packet loss is detected.

# Reduce the amount of SYN/ACKs the server will re-transmit to an ip address

# our server will always send a SYN/ACK in response to the client's initial

# flood" DoS attack's collateral damage by not sending SYN/ACKs back to spoofed
# ips, multiple times. If we do continue to send SYN/ACKs to spoofed IPs they
# may send RST's back to us and an "amplification" attack would begin against
# our host. If you do not wish to send retransmits at all then set to zero(0)
# especially if you are under a SYN attack. If our first SYN/ACK gets dropped
# the client will re-send another SYN if they still want to connect. Also set

# TCP Slow start gradually increases the data send rate until the TCP

# increment per ACK to (abc_l_var * maxseg) bytes. An abc_l_var of 44 times a

# Syncookies have advantages and disadvantages. Syncookies are useful if you
# are being DoS attacked as this method helps filter the proper clients from
# the attack machines. But, since the TCP options from the initial SYN are not
# saved in syncookies, the tcp options are not applied to the connection,
# precluding use of features like window scale, timestamps, or exact MSS
# sizing. As the returning ACK establishes the connection, it may be possible
# for an attacker to ACK flood a machine in an attempt to create a connection.
# Another benefit to overflowing to the point of getting a valid SYN cookie is
# the attacker can include data payload. Now that the attacker can send data to
# a FreeBSD network daemon, even using a spoofed source IP address, they can
# have FreeBSD do processing on the data which is not something the attacker

# RFC 6528 Initial Sequence Numbers (ISN) refer to the unique 32-bit sequence

# exhausted. In continuous communication all available ISN options could be
# used up in a few hours. Normally a new secret number is only chosen after the
# ISN limit has been exceeded. In order to defend against Sequence Number
# Attacks the ISN secret key should not be used sufficiently often that it
# would be regarded as predictable, and thus insecure. Reseeding the ISN will
# break TIME_WAIT recycling for a few minutes. BUT, for the more paranoid,
# simply choose a random number of seconds in which a new ISN secret should be

# TCP segmentation offload (TSO), also called large segment offload (LSO),

# size and would be dropped by a switch or the receiving machine, like for NFS
# fragmented traffic. If the packet is dropped the overall sending bandwidth is
# reduced significantly. You can also disable TSO in /etc/rc.conf using the
# "-tso" directive after the network card configuration; for example,
# ifconfig_igb0="inet 10.10.10.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 -tso". Verify TSO is off

# Fortuna pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) maximum event size is also
# referred to as the minimum pool size. Fortuna has a main generator which
# supplies the OS with PRNG data. The Fortuna generator is seeded by 32
# separate 'Fortuna' accumulation pools which each have to be filled with at
# least 'minpoolsize' bytes before being able to seed the OS with random bits.
# On FreeBSD, the default 'minpoolsize' of 64 bytes is an estimate of the
# minimum amount of bytes a new pool should contain to provide at least 128
# bits of entropy. After a pool is used in a generator reseed, that pool is
# reset to an empty string and must reach 'minpoolsize' bytes again before
# being used as a seed. Increasing the 'minpoolsize' allows higher entropy into
# the accumulation pools before being assimilated by the generator.
#
# The Fortuna authors state 64 bytes is safe enough even if an attacker
# influences some random source data. To be a bit more paranoid, we increase
# the 'minpoolsize' to 128 bytes so each pool will provide an absolute minimum
# of 256 bits of entropy, but realistically closer to 1024 bits of entropy, for
# each of the 32 Fortuna accumulation pools. Values of 128 bytes and 256 bytes
# are reasonable when coupled with a dedicated hardware based PRNG like the
# fast source Intel Secure Key RNG (PURE_RDRAND). Do not make the pool value
# too large as this will delay the reseed even if very good random sources are
# available. https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/fortuna.pdf
#
# FYI: on FreeBSD 11, values over 64 can incur additional reboot time to
# populate the pools during the "Feeding entropy:" boot stage. For example, a
# pool size value of 256 can add an additional 90 seconds to boot the machine.
# FreeBSD 12 has been patched to not incur the boot delay issue with larger

vfs.zfs.vdev.write_gap_limit=0      # max gap between any two aggregated writes, 0 to minimize frags (default 4096, 4KB)

# ZFS Tuning: The plan is to use large amounts of RAM for dirty_data_max to
# buffer incoming data before ZFS must commit the data in the next Transaction
# Group (TXG) to the physical drives in the pool. TXG commits are sequential by
# design; the incoming random write traffic cached between TXG commits is
# sequential when written to disk. If the server is able to keep more dirty
# "modified" data in RAM before the next TXG commit there is a greater chance
# of long sequential writes without holes. These long sequential stripes of
# written data also result in significantly faster sequential reads.

# ZFS will trigger a forced TXG commit when either the temporal limit
# txg.timeout or the data capacity limit dirty_data_sync is reached. Increasing
# these two(2) limits will allow the system to collect more uncommitted data in
# RAM in order to write to the vdev in efficient sequential stripes. But,
# understand, if the server losses power or crashes we lose all dirty data in
# RAM not previously committed; so make sure to be on an Uninterruptible Power
# Supply (UPS). A manual "sync" as well as a "shutdown" or "poweroff" will
# always force a commit of all data in RAM to disk.

# Dirty "modified" data in RAM can be read from, written to and modified even
# before the data is committed to disk. If the data set is rapidly changing,
# like during database transactions or bittorrent traffic, the changes will be
# made solely to RAM in between TXG commits. Only the latest copy of the data
# in RAM will be written to disk on TXG commit which is a good argument for an
# extended txg.timeout.

# The number of outstanding I/Os per top-level vdev should be set to the
# maximum Queue Depth of the storage device times the number of threads
# supported by the storage device. According to the white sheets for NVMe
# devices the queue depth is 32 and concurrent thread support is four (QD 32
# Thread 4). Set the top_maxinflight to a queue depth of 32 (Q32) times four(4)
# threads times one(1) NVMe drive to equal 128 max number of outstanding I/Os
# per top-level vdev. (32_queues_*_4_threads_*_1_drive=128).

# Make sure to never, ever reach the dirty_data_sync capacity limit especially
# if the zfs logbias is set to "latency". Logbias latency will double write the
# same incoming data to ZIL and to the disk when dirty_data_sync is reached.
# Take a look at zfs logbias "throughput" to avoid these double writes. When the
# server is accepting data on a 1Gbit interface the dirty_data_sync should be
# larger than the true incoming throughput of the network times the
# txg.timeout; 118MB/sec times 90 seconds will require 10.62 gigabytes of
# dirty_data_sync RAM space which is 880 megabytes below our value of
# dirty_data_sync.

# When determining the size of the dirty_data_max look at the amount of fast,
# first and second tier cache available in the NVMe drives. All of the data in
# a completely filled dirty_data_max cache should be able to be committed to
# the drive well before the next txg.timeout even if a saturated network is
# concurrently writing data to dirty_data_max.
#
# The ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro 1TB NVMe has 165 gigabytes of first tier SLC cache
# and 500 gigabytes of of second tier MLC, dynamic cache. The SX8200 can write
# at 2.62 gigabytes per second to the first tier SLC cache when the drive is
# properly cooled meaning 10.62 gigabytes of dirty_data_sync can be committed
# to the NVMe drive in four(4) seconds, well before the next txg.timeout.
#
# The Samsung 960 EVO NVMe 1TB has six(6) gigabytes of first tier cache plus
# thirty six(36) gigabytes of second tier, dynamic cache. The 960 EVO can write
# at 1.95 gigabytes per second when the drive is properly cooled meaning 10.62
# gigabytes of dirty_data_sync can be committed to the NVMe drive in less than
# six(6) seconds, well before the next txg.timeout.
#
# Enzotech BMR-C1 passive copper heat sinks (14mm x 14mm x 14mm, C1100 forged
# copper, 8-pack) work well to cool our NVMe drives.

# The ZFS commit logic order is strictly sync_read, sync_write, async_read,
# async_write and finally scrub/resilver .

# Firewall: Ip Forwarding to allow packets to traverse between interfaces and

# options are handled by the normal IP input processing path. All features of
# the normal (slow) IP forwarding path are supported by fast forwarding
# including firewall (through pfil(9) hooks) checking, except ipsec tunnel
# brokering. The IP fast forwarding path does not generate ICMP redirect or

# counter because the packet was not dropped, but lost by the network card
# during the transition phase. The Intel i350-T2 only requires 4.4 watts with

# caching layer mapping interfaces to routes to IPs and saves a lookup to the
# Forward Information Base (FIB); a routing table within the network stack. The
# IPv4 routing cache was intended to eliminate a FIB lookup and increase
# performance. While a good idea in principle, unfortunately it provided a very
# small performance boost in less than 10% of connections and opens up the
# possibility of a DoS vector. Setting rtexpire and rtminexpire to ten(10)
# seconds should be sufficient to protect the route table from attack.

# somaxconn is the OS buffer, backlog queue depth for accepting new incoming TCP
# connections. An application will have its own, separate max queue length
# (maxqlen) which can be checked with "netstat -Lan". The default is 128
# connections per application thread. Lets say your Nginx web server normally
# receives 100 connections/sec and is single threaded application. If clients
# are bursting in at a total of 250 connections/sec you may want to set the
# somaxconn at 512 to be a 512 deep connection buffer so the extra 122 clients
# (250-128=122) do not get denied service since you would have 412
# (512-100=412) extra queue slots. Also, a large listen queue will do a better
# job of avoiding Denial of Service (DoS) attacks if, and only if, your
# application can handle the TCP load at the cost of more RAM and CPU time.
# Nginx sets is backlog queue to the same as the OS somaxconn by default.
# Note: "kern.ipc.somaxconn" is not shown in "sysctl -a" output, but searching
# for "kern.ipc.soacceptqueue" gives the same value and both directives stand
# for the same buffer value.

# The TCP window scale (rfc3390) option is used to increase the TCP receive
# window size above its maximum value of 65,535 bytes (64k). TCP Time Stamps
# (rfc1323) allow nearly every segment, including retransmissions, to be
# accurately timed at negligible computational cost. Both options should be
# enabled by default. Enhancing TCP Loss Recovery (rfc3042) says on packet
# loss, trigger the fast retransmit algorithm instead of tcp timeout.

# FreeBSD limits the maximum number of TCP reset (RST) and ICMP Unreachable
# packets the server will send every second. Limiting reply packets helps curb
# the effects of Brute-force TCP denial of service (DoS) attacks and UDP port
# scans. Also, when Pf firewall client states expire FreeBSD will send out RST
# packets to tell the client the connection is closed. By default, FreeBSD will
# send out 200 packets per second.
#net.inet.icmp.icmplim=1  # (default 200)
#net.inet.icmp.icmplim_output=0  # (default 1)

# Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) allows the receiver to inform the sender of
# packets which have been received and if any packets were dropped. The sender
# can then selectively retransmit the missing data without needing to
# retransmit entire blocks of data that have already been received
# successfully. SACK option is not mandatory and support must be negotiated
# when the connection is established using TCP header options. An attacker
# downloading large files can abuse SACK by asking for many random segments to
# be retransmitted. The server in response wastes system resources trying to
# fulfill superfluous requests. If you are serving small files to low latency
# clients then SACK can be disabled. If you see issues of flows randomly
# pausing, try disabling SACK to see if there is equipment in the path which
# does not handle SACK correctly.
#net.inet.tcp.sack.enable=1  # (default 1)

# host cache is the client's cached tcp connection details and metrics (TTL,
# SSTRESH and VARTTL) the server can use to improve future performance of
# connections between the same two hosts. When a tcp connection is completed,
# our server will cache information about the connection until an expire
# timeout. If a new connection between the same client is initiated before the
# cache has expired, the connection will use the cached connection details to
# setup the connection's internal variables. This pre-cached setup allows the
# client and server to reach optimal performance significantly faster because
# the server will not need to go through the usual steps of re-learning the
# optimal parameters for the connection. Unfortunately, this can also make
# performance worse because the hostcache will apply the exception case to
# every new connection from a client within the expire time. In other words, in
# some cases, one person surfing your site from a mobile phone who has some
# random packet loss can reduce your server's performance to this visitor even
# when their temporary loss has cleared.  3900 seconds allows clients who
# connect regularly to stay in our hostcache. To view the current host cache
# stats use "sysctl net.inet.tcp.hostcache.list" . If you have
# "net.inet.tcp.hostcache.cachelimit=0" like in our /boot/loader.conf example
# then this expire time is negated and not uesd.
#net.inet.tcp.hostcache.expire=3900  # (default 3600)

# By default, acks are delayed by 100 ms or sent every other packet in order to
# improve the chance of being added to another returned data packet which is
# full. This method can cut the number of tiny packets flowing across the
# network and is efficient. But, delayed ACKs cause issues on modern, short
# hop, low latency networks. TCP works by increasing the congestion window,
# which is the amount of data currently traveling on the wire, based on the
# number of ACKs received per time frame. Delaying the timing of the ACKs
# received results in less data on the wire, time in TCP slowstart is doubled
# and in congestion avoidance after packet loss the congestion window growth is
# slowed.  Setting delacktime higher then 100 will to slow downloads as ACKs
# are queued too long. On low latecy 10gig links we find a value of 20ms is
# optimal. http://www.tel.uva.es/personales/ignmig/pdfs/ogonzalez_NOC05.pdf
